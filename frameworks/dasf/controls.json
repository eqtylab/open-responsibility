    "description": "Mosaic AI Vector Search is a vector database that is built into the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform and integrated with its governance and productivity tools. A vector database is a database that is optimized to store and retrieve embeddings. Embeddings are mathematical representations of the semantic content of data, typically text or image data. Embeddings are usually generated by feature extraction models for text, image, audio or multi-modal data, and are a key component of many GenAI applications that depend on finding documents or images that are similar to each other. Examples are RAG systems, recommender systems, and image and video recognition. Databricks implements the following security controls to protect your data: Every customer request to Vector Search is logically isolated, authenticated and authorized, and Mosaic AI Vector Search encrypts all data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).",
